# Release history

Cortana preserves published tags and corrects release metadata with a new patch
release instead of rewriting an existing tag.

The transitional `v0.1.2` release shipped the production installer and platform
archives while the Rust version update was being migrated from the legacy
single-package flow. The following patch release reconciles the Release Please
manifest, Rust crate, Python package, web application, and lockfile versions
under the automated manifest flow.

Generated version pull requests are restricted to changelog and configured
version files, then merged automatically without running the code-change test
matrix. Topic and staging-to-main promotion pull requests still run the complete
CI, test, security, and CodeQL gates.
